  - This filter list is for obtrusive overlay (pop up) elements and various other annoying elements on websites. 
  The main purpose of this filter list is blocking overlay elements that pop up when websites want you to sign in / register, 
  choose a region (even though you clearly entered a specific geographical version of a site with the intention of visiting 
  that geographical version), answer a survey, subscribe to something, etc. The secondary purpose is to block other slightly 
  less annoying elements that doesn't pop up, such as privacy notices boxes.
