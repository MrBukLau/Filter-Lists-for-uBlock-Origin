## Description
These are filter lists for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) that remove elements from certain websites, making them easier to navigate through without any annoyances.

## Disclaimer
These filter lists were only tested on [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) using [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm). They may or may not work on other web browsers and ad blockers. Also, these are my personal filter lists and may not suit everyone. If there are some filters  you disagree with, then feel free to click on the **"Fork"** button and make your own list using these filters.

## How to Add a Filter List to an Ad Blocker
In order to add one of these filter lists to an ad blocker, make sure you have an ad blocker installed on your web browser. I recommend using [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), but these filter lists could possibly work with any other ad blockers. Once you have an ad blocker installed on your web browser, you can left-click on any of the **"Subscribe"** button below to automatically add a filter list to your ad blocker. Alternatively, you can manually add one of these filter lists by [following the guide on how to import external lists in uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Filter-lists-from-around-the-web).

| **[iOS](https://github.com/MrBukLau/filter-lists-for-ublock-origin/blob/master/filter_lists/iosfilterlist.txt)** | This filter list was only tested on the iOS version of AdGuard. Unlike the other filter lists here, this one is not for uBlock Origin. However, the filters might work on it, but I have not tried it. Special thanks to [u/busymom0](https://www.reddit.com/user/busymom0) on Reddit for discovering some of these filters and posting them on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/av3frt/i_figured_out_a_way_to_permanently_hide_the_4/). </br></br> Here is how you can put this filter list onto the iOS version of AdGuard: </br> 1. Copy the filters from the text file </br> 2. Click on **"User filter"** in AdGuard </br> 3. Paste what you copied from the text file
